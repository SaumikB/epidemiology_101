All of us know the recent condition related to the COVID-19 outbreak. All our social platforms are flooded with various messages related to it. Some are good, some are fake, and some are pretty confusing and difficult to verify. In the midst of this information  spread, I receive a post from my collaborator Sayantari which was fascinating. We were particularly excited as we have a common interest in the study of epidemiological dynamics. We performed couple of oversimplified experiments to evaluate the present situation, and the effectiveness of the precautions that we are taking.
Consider there are initially two types of people present in any situation- sick person and healthy person. If a healthy person comes in contact with a sick person then with some finite probability, both of them turn into sick person. In case of highly infectios disease this probability is close to one. However, a sick person will recover eventually. Once recovered, that person may or may not get the infection again. In a framework where a recovered person may have infection again is more alarming, and recent studies are showing that COVID-19 might attack same person twice. So, we have different frameworks, like, susceptible-infected (SI) epidemic framework where infected person never recovers, susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic framework  where infected person recovers, and never gets infected, or susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) epidemic framework  where infected person recovers and then again may have the infection.

## Disclaimar
This post is to visualize the dynamics of epidemic spreads in a simple way. The real situation is much complex, and nowhere near to these simulations. So, you must constantly follow the government instructions and precaustions suggested by WHO.
